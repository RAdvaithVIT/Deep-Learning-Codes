# Deep-Learning-Codes-
This is a repository centred along the lines of deep learning using tensorflow, starting from basic regression, classification to convolution and so on.

1. ANN Regression - This is an artifical neural network created for regression on a manually input function.
2. ANN with MNIST - This is an ANN to classify the handwritten numbers in the MNIST datasets as its respective numbers
3. CNN with Fashion MNIST - This is a convolutional neural network using the fashion MNIST dataset, which is slightly more difficult than regular MNIST for the model to learn.
